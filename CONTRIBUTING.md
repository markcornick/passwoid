# Contributing To My JavaScript Code

I'm not a JavaScript wizard by any means, nor am I too proud to accept
contributions that improve my code, so if you think you have a problem,
improvement, or other contribution towards the betterment of JS-kind, please
file an issue or, where appropriate, a pull request.

When filing an issue, please explain exactly what's wrong in as much detail as
you can, and try not to insult me in doing so. "It doesn't work, fix it" or "It
doesn't work, you're an idiot" are not helpful issues. "I try to do this, I
expect this, but I get that" or "I think you missed a step here in line 32" are
better. Keep in mind that I'm not paid to write JavaScript code, so I'm doing
this in my spare time, which means it might take me a while to respond. If
you're not satisfied with my response to your problem with my free (as in beer
and in speech) software, I will give you triple your $0.00 back.

When filing a pull request, please explain what you're changing and why. Please
use [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard) and add or
update tests as needed. Please limit your changes to the specific thing you're
fixing and isolate your changes in a topic branch that I can merge without
pulling in other stuff.

All of my JavaScript code uses the ISC license. If you submit a pull request,
I'll assume you are OK with any code you add being placed under that same ISC
license. If this is not the case for any reason, please let me know why you
can't tolerate the ISC license. I am 99.99% likely to reject your change in that
case, but I'll let you have your say.

Thanks for contributing!
