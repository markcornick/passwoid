# Contributing To My JavaScript Code

I'm not a JavaScript wizard by any means, nor am I too proud to accept
contributions that improve my code, so if you think you have a problem,
improvement, or other contribution towards the betterment of JS-kind,
please file an issue or, where appropriate, a pull request.

Before filing an issue, please read this article by my friends and
former colleagues at Viget:

[https://viget.com/extend/tips-for-writing-better-bug-reports][1]

Keep in mind that I'm not paid to write JavaScript code, so I'm doing this
in my spare time, which means it might take me a while to respond. If
you're not satisfied with my response to your problem with my free (as
in beer and in speech) software, I will give you triple your $0.00 back.

When filing a pull request, please explain what you're changing and why.
Please use [Prettier style][2] and add or update tests as needed. `npm
test` will run tests, check style, and calculate coverage; make sure it
passes, and that coverage does not drop below 100%. Please limit your
changes to the specific thing you're fixing and isolate your changes in
a topic branch that I can merge without pulling in other stuff.

This project is now using [Conventional Changelog][4] style. Please follow
this convention. [Commitizen][5] makes this easier.

This project uses the Apache-2.0 license. If you submit a pull request, I'll
assume you are OK with any code you add being placed under that same Apache-2.0
license.

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and
contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant][3] code of
conduct.

Thanks for contributing!
