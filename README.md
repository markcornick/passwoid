# powm [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markcornick/powm.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/markcornick/powm) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/markcornick/powm/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/markcornick/powm?branch=master)

> A reasonably secure password generator

powm generates reasonably secure passwords. That's it; that's all it does.

Starting with version 3.0.0, the powm CLI has been separated into a new
package called [powm-cli](https://github.com/markcornick/powm-cli). The
CLI is no longer included in this package.

The passwords generated by powm are strings of random characters. Passwords are
chosen from the set of all upper-case letters except I and O, all lower-case
letters except l, and the digits 2 through 9. 0 and O are not used to avoid
confusion with each other when passwords are displayed in sans-serif fonts. I,
l, and 1 are not used for the same reason. Passwords are guaranteed to contain
at least one upper-case letter, one lower-case letter, and one number.

The default length is 16. The minimum length is 3, because a shorter password
would not satisfy the requirement to use all three classes of characters.

Prior to version 2.0.0, powm guaranteed that passwords would not repeat any
characters, and enforced a maximum length of 57, because a longer password would
not satisfy this requirement. Starting with version 2.0.0, powm will create
a password of any length of 3 or greater, and guarantees that passwords will not
repeat any characters if the requested length is 57 or less.

powm is based on [pwm](https://github.com/markcornick/pwm), my Ruby
implementation of a similar concept. powm differs from pwm in that powm enforces
the no-repeated-characters requirement, but pwm does not. (The name change is
because "pwm" was already taken as a package name on npm.)

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save powm
```

## Usage

```js
var powm = require('powm');

powm();  // returns a password of the default length (16)
powm(8); // returns a password of length 8
powm(1); // throws Error: Cannot generate password of length 1
```
